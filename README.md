In the modern world, machine learning can be applied in many different contexts. In machine learning, numerous techniques and applications develop. Predicting house price trends is one of these applications. By using some Python libraries, this project gives us a general overview of how to foretell the price of a house using several machine learning methods. The ability to predict house prices aims in determining the cost to sell a house in a specific area and assists buyers in finding a house that meets their criteria. Numerous aspects, like the house's location, its size, its age, the type of material used in its construction, the number of bedrooms and garages, and others, affect the price of a house. The Machine Learning model is constructed for Bangalore City. Random Forest algorithm is used in the project. This project is implemented using Scikit-Learn Machine Learning Tool.

Keywords:  Machine Learning, Random Forest, Scikit-Learn.
